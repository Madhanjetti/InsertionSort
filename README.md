# InsertionSort in C
Insertion Sort is a sorting algorithm where the array is sorted by taking one element at a time. The principle behind insertion sort is to take one element, iterate through the sorted array & find its correct position in the sorted array.

Step 1 − If the element is the first one, it is already sorted.
Step 2 – Move to next element
Step 3 − Compare the current element with all elements in the sorted array
Step 4 – If the element in the sorted array is smaller than the current element, iterate to the next element. Otherwise, shift all the greater element in the array by one position towards right
Step 5 − Insert the value at the correct position
Step 6 − Repeat until the complete list is sorted
